#This repository contains files generated to create a printf function using the C language. 
#It has been made with reference to printf man 3. 
#It is important to mention that the following format specifiers have been taken into account in this project:

#c - char data type

#s - String data type

#d - Integer data type

#i - Integer data type

#The format specifiers set the type of data to print in a printf function. 
#To use these specifiers it is necessary to prepend the% sign, therefore it will also be used in this project.

#It should be mentioned that printf is a function capable of printing a string on the screen, 
#this string can contain different types of data, receives a variable number of arguments of different types 
#and prints them in the order indicated. Below you will find an example of using a printf function:

#int counter;

#counter = 20;

#printf ("The value is% d", counter);

#Result: The value is 20

#For this example we have created a variable of integer type called counter that has an initial value of 20. 
#We want to print this value together with the string "The Value is", 
#to achieve this we call the printf function and use the string as parameters mentioned above and immediately 
#after we use the% sign together with the letter d, which establishes that the value to be printed in this case will 
#be an integer, since the variable is of the integer type, finally we would pass the name of the variable as a parameter.

#Different types of strings and numbers have been taken into account to carry out the necessary tests. 
#Based on this project, a manual has been created for our printf function. 
#This manual is part of the files contained in this repository.
